# We are Oculus

Not the company, the [SF Hacks 2017](https://sfhacks.io) team.

Over the course of > 24 hours, we created an immersive virtual experience with
support for controller free user interaction using a hand motion sensor.

## Hardware

We created the project using the Unity game engine, building onto a consumer
model Oculus Rift virtual reality (VR) headset borrowed from **MLH**. We
modified the VR headset (seen below) to track hand motions by mounting a Leap
Motion (also **MLH**) sensor to the front of the device.

Here is a front view of the Oculus VR with Leap Motion sensor

The placement of the sensor necessitates that the user is staring at their hands
while operating them. This is a hardware issue, but is normal user behavior.

To complete our completely professional hardware mod, we relied on Duck Tape
(also **MLH**).
