A hackathon project for [SF Hacks 2017](https://sfhacks.io), posted on
  [HackerEarth](https://sfhacks.hackerearth.com/sprints/sf-hacks-1/dashboard/CatchTheseHands/submission/).

## Installation

The project is built with Unity using the Oculus SDK. We physically attached the
Leap Motion sensor to the front of the Oculus in order to track hand motion to
deliver a fully interactive experience.

The final version of our project can be opened in Unity with the folder `Roll a
ball Game version 2.0`.
